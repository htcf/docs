# High Throughput Computing Facility @ CGS_SB

The Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology is the proud home of The High Throughput Computing Facility, a Washington University [recharge center](http://research.wustl.edu/ComplianceAreas/RechargeCenters/Pages/default.aspx).  The HTCF provides high-throughput computational resources for researchers within the CGS_SB.


An HTCF description for grant writing purposes


> The CGSSB provides a computational cluster for high-throughput bioinformatics. The cluster consists of around 2000 processors and over 30TB of RAM.  It supports the Center's Illumina sequencing platforms and real time sequencing analysis. Long term data storage is handled by our 40 GbE connected storage arrays. These arrays are currently over 4 petabytes in size. All user data is backed up and stored daily, weekly and monthly. A disaster recovery copy of select data is stored offsite.
>
> The HTCF also includes a 750TB high-speed distributed file system. This, coupled with its 100Gb network backbone, delivering 10Gb of bandwidth to cluster nodes, the HTCF can provide exceptionally high-speed transfer of large amounts of data.
