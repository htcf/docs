An HTCF description for grant writing purposes


> The Center of Genome Sciences and Systems Biology offers access to its advanced High-Throughput Computing Facility (HTCF), a computational cluster tailored for bioinformatics research, catering to the computational demands of the Center's sequencing platforms and users.
> 
> The HTCF cluster comprises over 2500 processors, including nodes optimized for GPU processing, and a 40TB RAM capacity.  These resources are optimized to handle high-throughput bioinformatics workflows, support real-time sequencing analysis, and ensure efficient execution of computational tasks.
> 
> Cluster storage is accessed via dozens of 25 GbE-connected storage arrays, supported by a 100GbE network backbone, and totaling over 7 petabytes in capacity. Comprehensive backup procedures, including daily and monthly snapshots, are in place to safeguard research data. Additionally, disaster recovery copies of long-term data are securely stored offsite.  A 750TB distributed scratch file system is also available.
